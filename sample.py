        input: I agree with time magazines assessment.  They are exciting because they bring a lot of freshness to the workplace which helps us to do better. They are also threatening because of their lack of longer commitment and emotional weakness in the workplace.
        They deserve to be recognized as change force, but they don't really justify the hype given.
        The Fresh workforce brings lots of unconventional ideas, work practices, and huge expectations. Their inherent assumption and/or desire that everything needs to be changed should be tamed. Their lack of understanding of the complex problem is worrisome. They are not very good at making tradeoffs. They want everything at the same time which is a disregard for natural evolution.

        The text presents a mixed sentiment with both positive and negative aspects. The positive sentiment is evident in phrases like "exciting," "bring a lot of freshness," and "helps us to do better," indicating enthusiasm towards the Fresh workforce's impact.

        input: from personal experience – working from home well over 10 years now – one imp thing is trust. Work-life balance works only if employees are trusted. If they are not trusted, they will act untrustworthy way. In millennial generation – we had parental leaves, flexible working hours, 13 day fortnight (you work extra hours every day to get every second Friday as off) and flexibility in holidays.

        input: The main challenge is to make them understand the work and what has to be delivered professionally. The understanding process is much faster but it takes more time to set expectations with them. Once they understand they proceed and are committed but the initial process is very challenging. They demand more information for the work required, they do not like to be given part or piecemeal information. They want the complete holistic picture and to their satisfaction. Only then do they start working which gets tedious at times when there are strict deadlines and someone wants to research on tertiary unimportant aspects.  They cannot be enforced, they want complete guidance and information, and then they deliver very well above expectations. -(can you suggest some positive words for the above negative context)"
        output: Certainly! Here are some positive words and phrases that can be used to reframe the negative context:
        
        1. Opportunity (instead of challenge)
        2. Efficient (instead of takes more time)
        3. Inquisitive (instead of demanding)
        4. Engaging (instead of tedious)
        5. Ambitious goals (instead of strict deadlines)
        6. Key aspects (instead of tertiary unimportant aspects)
        7. Self-motivated (instead of cannot be enforced)
        8. Thorough understanding (instead of want complete guidance and information)
        9. Thorough research (instead of research on tertiary unimportant aspects)
        10. Proactive (instead of excessive information-seeking)
        11. Focus on priorities (instead of consequences of focusing too much)
        12. Deliberate decision-making (instead of stuck in analysis paralysis)
        
        By using more positive language, you can shift the perspective and promote a more constructive and optimistic outlook on the situation. This can help create a more productive and harmonious work environment.

        input: One of the most challenging projects I worked on was during my internship at Company X. I was assigned to develop a mobile app with a tight deadline. The initial requirements were not clearly defined, and there were constant changes from stakeholders. To address this, I proactively scheduled regular meetings with the team and stakeholders to clarify requirements and expectations. I also broke down the project into smaller tasks and set realistic milestones. By maintaining open communication and adaptability, we were able to deliver the app on time and received positive feedback from the users.

The candidate discusses a challenging project but focuses on the proactive steps taken to address the difficulties and achieve success.

Your proactive approach in scheduling meetings, clarifying requirements, breaking down the project, and setting realistic milestones demonstrated strong problem-solving skills and adaptability.
        
        Additionally, you emphasized the importance of open communication and collaboration, which are crucial qualities in any team environment.

        input: One of the key positive traits that defines me is my relentless determination. When faced with challenges, I don't back down easily. Instead, I see them as opportunities for growth and improvement. For example, at my previous job, we encountered a project that seemed impossible to complete within the given deadline. While some team members became disheartened, I took the lead to motivate everyone and explore alternative solutions. In the end, we successfully completed the project ahead of schedule, and it was a tremendous learning experience for all of us.(what are the negative words used in above given transcript by me?)
        output: The negative words used in the above transcript are "impossible," "disheartened," and "ahead of schedule." The word "impossible" is used to describe the project that the team was working on, which was seen as a challenge. The word "disheartened" is used to describe the team members who became discouraged when they realized that the project was difficult. The word "ahead of schedule" is used to describe the fact that the team was able to complete the project before the deadline, which was a positive outcome.
